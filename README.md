# Homemade OS

After taking CS 350 at UW, I wanted to try and build my own operating system from the ground up. After looking online I found some info on how to build an OS, but I'm gonna try and do something piece by piece. This repo is going to not only hold my OS, but also my learnings and tracking my changes. I'm hoping to do this consistently, but life and school gets in the way a lot for me, so I'll keep tracking things in my journal entries.
